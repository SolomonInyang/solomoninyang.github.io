							<h2>Solomon Inyang</h2>
							<p>Welcome! Iâ€™m Solomon. I'm a researcher studying AI in games as well as a hobbyist game developer.  <br />
							My research focus is on human-AI interaction and the use of AI to enhance team cognition <br />
							in multiplayer games. I also like to build small experimental games that feature innovative game <br />
							mechanics and player experiences. Some of the games I've made are listed below and available to <br/>
							play on itch.io <a href="https://solomoninyang.itch.io/"> here</a>.</p>

								<h2>Project Overview<br /></h2>
								<p>Our aim for the forest digital twin was to build a virtual
								model that can simulate the growth and development of trees over time.
								By integrating satellite image data, climate models and historical crop growth 
								data, the forest digital twin provides farmers and land owners with accurate
								projections of how their forest will change over time. </p>

								<h2>Language Bot</h2>
								<p>An educational game for learning French. The player gains points by helping <br/ >
								a robot character translate procedurally generated French phrases to English. <br/ >
								One life is lost for every word the player gets incorrect and the game ends when <br/ >
								the player loses all three of their lives.</p>

								<h2>Occult Island</h2>
								<p>An experimental simulation horror game developed as part of my <br />
								honours thesis at the Australian National University. The player assigns <br />
								tasks to a group of survivors that have been shipwrecked on an island in <br />
								order to help them escape. The game introduces a novel game AI technique called <br />
								"Mental State Modelling" which is used to create believable autonomous agents <br />
								 that exhibit behaviours based on various internal mental states including <br />
								 perceptions, motivations and emotions.</p>

								<h2>Future Work</h2>
								<p>Here are a few additional features that we plan to add<br />
								as development continues.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
									<h3>Deeper Simulation</h3>
									<p>In future versions of the tool, we plan to implement additional ecological simulation modules such as wind, sunlight, and infiltration, in addition to agroforestry practices such as alley cropping that will allow land owners
									to evaluate the potential ramifications of these practices in a consequence free environment. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-paw">
									<h3>Livestock</h3>
									<p>Agent-based livestock will be a future addition that will allow users to see what effect grazing animals have on natural processes like crop growth and pasture quality, allowing users to take these effects into consideration when managing their land.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3> Recommendation System </h3>
									<p>An AI-powered recommendation system is a future milestone that will provide users with suggestions on the best way to achieve specific productivity goals and implement certain management practices. These recommendations will be personalised for each individual farm based on geographical features.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-check-square">
									<h3>Gamification</h3>
									<p>Gamification mechanics such as user objectives will be added in future versions to enhance user experience and engagement. These objectives will generate certain productivity goals for users to achieve such as maximising yield.</p>
